A brief view about me
What is up, I'm Dinh Minh or you can shortly call me by minhxiro. I'm currently a Software Engineer student at RMIT who got involved in many school projects. Typically, I just finished a full stack web page development for RMIT HN Event, which you can view on my profile. Additionally, I am familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C/C++, Python, SQL and SPSS so, if you get any interesting projects, please be free to invite me OwO. Nice to see ya, mate <3
